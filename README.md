<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Using Keyness relative frequency analyses and structural topic modelling, this paper explores
the differences in coverage of the war in Ukraine between Fox News and CNN. My research
relies on monologue transcripts from the Fox and CNN websites that aired between February
25 and March 31, 2022.

### Packages

Analysis for this paper was conducted in R, relying on the Quanteda package for textual manipulation. (http://quanteda.io/)

### Data

Transcripts were scraped from the Fox News and CNN websites using a free web scraper available as a Google Chrome extension. For Fox News, transcripts were simply scraped from the network’s transcript archive (foxnews.com/transcript), while for CNN, transcripts from four of the network’s top rated hosts (Wolf Blitzer, Jake Tapper, Don Lemon, and Anderson Cooper) were scraped from their separate online transcript archives. In both cases, metadata–including the transcript title, the air date/time, and the URL–was also collected.

### Conclusion

The results of my paper showed that while Fox and CNN initially both devoted extensive time to the war in Ukraine, the biases of network hosts and the institutional incentives of the networks still resulted in different narratives about the conflict.
